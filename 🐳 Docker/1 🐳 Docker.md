# 🐳 Docker Components Explained

## 🛠️ Dockerfile
- A text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image
- Specifies the base image, environment variables, commands to run, and files to copy
- Each instruction creates a new layer in the Docker image
- Example instructions: FROM, RUN, COPY, ENV, EXPOSE, CMD, etc.
- Helps in automation and consistency across different environments

## 🖼️ Docker Image
- A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes:
  - Code
  - Runtime
  - Libraries
  - Environment variables
  - System tools
- Read-only (immutable) and layered, built from the Dockerfile
- Can be inherited from a base image (like python:3.9 or ubuntu:20.04)
- Stored in a registry, such as:
  - Docker Hub (public)
  - AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
  - Azure Container Registry (ACR)

## 🐳 Docker Container
- A running instance of a Docker image
- Containers are isolated environments that run applications
- Multiple containers can be created from the same image
- Containers share the same kernel as the host machine but have their own file system, network, and processes
- By default, a container only lives until the process inside is running (e.g., a Node.js app or Python script)

## 🔥 Container Lifecycle
- `docker run` → Creates and starts a container
- `docker stop` → Stops a running container
- `docker restart` → Restarts a container
- `docker rm` → Removes a container
- `docker logs` → View container logs

## 📊 Docker Workflow

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|              Dockerfile                           |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| - Base Image: Node:16-alpine                     |
| - ENV variables (NODE_ENV, PORT, DB_HOST)        |
| - Install dependencies                            |
| - Copy application code                           |
| - Expose port 3000                                |
| - CMD to run the app                              |
+---------------------------------------------------+
      ↓
      ↓  Docker Build Command
      ↓  `docker build -t myapp .`
+---------------------------------------------------+
|              Docker Image                         |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| - Contains code, runtime, libraries, env vars    |---> | Push to Docker Hub | ECR |
| - Layered structure                               |
| - Immutable and reusable                          |
| - Stored in Docker Hub or private registry       |
+---------------------------------------------------+
      ↓
      ↓  Docker Run Command
      ↓  `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 myapp`
+---------------------------------------------------+
|            Docker Container                       |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| - Running instance of the image                   |
| - Isolated environment                            |
| - Own file system, network, and processes        |
| - Runs app on port 3000                          |
| - Dies when process stops                         |
