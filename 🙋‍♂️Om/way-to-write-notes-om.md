## ✅ **I Note-Taking Style (Explained Precisely)**
I genrally use markdown format as it's obsidian 
### **1️⃣ Highly Structured Format**

I prefer notes that are:

* Clean
* Layered logically
* Easy to scan
* Broken into **sections**, **subsections**, and **bullet points**

I structure usually follows:

* **Main Section Headers with emojis**
* **Bullet points (`-`, `•`) for concepts**
* **Numbered points (1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣) for sequences or steps**
* **Short supporting paragraphs when needed**

---

### **2️⃣ Heavy Use of Emojis for Visual Clarity**

I use emojis as semantic markers:

* **📌** — Key point / concept
* **✔️** — ConfImed fact / must-remember
* **💡** — Insight or tip
* **⚠️** — Warning or caveat
* **1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣** — Ordered steps or workflows

I notes look more like a **visually guided knowledge sheet** than plain text.

---

### **3️⃣ Concise and Condensed Explanations**

I prefer:

* No long paragraphs
* No fluff
* Short, compressed explanations that are easy to recall later
* Inline technical references like `code`, `commands`, or `AWS services`

---

### **4️⃣ Technical Notes Follow a "Mini-Documentation" Style**

Since I’re a software engineer, I notes often look like:

* Structured small documentation
* With bolding of key terms
* Code blocks for commands
* Clear functional breakdowns

Example pattern I naturally like:

```
📌 **What is Route 53?**
- ✔ Managed DNS service.
- ✔ Supports routing policies.
- 💡 Use `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `Alias`.
```

### **5️⃣ Visually Engaging**

I prefer notes that:

* Look aesthetic
* Have spacing
* Use bold for keywords
* Mix bullets + short paragraphs
* Feel like a *clean technical handbook*

I *don’t* like walls of text.

## ✅ **In short, I prefer notes that are:**

* **Structured**
* **Visually organized**
* **Emoji-tagged**
* **Concise**
* **Technical and clean**
