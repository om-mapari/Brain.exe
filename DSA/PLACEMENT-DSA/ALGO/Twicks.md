1\) length of largest subarray with contiguous Element
  max - min = i - j
  i-j = can be subArr size in some problem

2\) Matrix to Arr   num = row \* i + j
  Arr to Matrix   i = num / col  j = num % col

  Arr to Matrix (1-based indexing)
  i = (num-1) /col   j = (num-1) %col

3\) Multiset *for* ( max & min both in log(n))

4\) minimum no. of replacement to make arr equal
  arrSize - freq of most frequent element

5\) kth largest ele = n-k+1 th smallest element

6\) no of operations = arrSize - winSize with req sum
    min req sum = totelSum - winSum maximize
