1.  Stable sorting Algorithm
When the original order is maintain for value that are equal

**Ex. 10 20 20 30 10**

**10 10 20 20 30 =\> stable**

**10 10 20 20 30 =\> unstable**

stable = Bubble, Merge, Insersion

Unstable = selection, quick, HeapSort

An Inplace Sorting algo take constant amount of extra memory

2.  When to Use Which Sort

Only a few items =\> INSERTION SORT

Items are mostly sorted already =\> INSERTION SORT

Concerned about worst-case scenarios =\> HEAP SORT

Interested in a good average-case result =\> QUICKSORT

Items are drawn from a dense universe =\> BUCKET SORT

Desire to write as little code as possible =\> INSERTION SORT

Data is already sorted by another criterion =\> MERGE SORT
