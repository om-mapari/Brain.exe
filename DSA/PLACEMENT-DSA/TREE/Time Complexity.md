In BFS
0(N) =\> As we triverse all nodes
0(n) =\> Max no of nodes at perticulear level

Best Case =
Wrost Case =

In DFS
0(N) =\> As we triverse all nodes
0(h) =\> max height of tree or stack space \| it also called as auxiliary space

=======================================================================

more Explnation
Best Case = 0(h) Perfect binery tree h = log(n) n = leaf nodes
Wrost Case = log(N) Skew tree (h == N) i.e degenrated linked list

*Auxiliary Space*= the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.
