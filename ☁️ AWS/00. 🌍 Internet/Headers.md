The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header is an HTTP header used to identify the **original IP address of a client** connecting to a web server **through a proxy, load balancer, or CDN**.

**💡 Why it's needed:**
When a request passes through a proxy or load balancer, the origin server sees the IP of that intermediary instead of the real client. The X-Forwarded-For header helps retain the original client's IP.

**🧾 Format:**

makefile
CopyEdit
X-Forwarded-For: client_ip, proxy1_ip, proxy2_ip
- client_ip: the original client's IP address
- proxy1_ip, proxy2_ip: subsequent proxy or load balancer IPs (optional)

**✅ Example:**

makefile
CopyEdit
X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.1, 198.51.100.101
- 203.0.113.1: original client
- 198.51.100.101: the proxy/load balancer

**🔒 Security Note:**
- This header can be **spoofed** by clients, so don't blindly trust it.
- Use trusted proxies and configure web servers to only accept XFF from them.
