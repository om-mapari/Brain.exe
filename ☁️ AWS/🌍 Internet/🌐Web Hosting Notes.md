Traditional Hosting
Traditional hosting involves renting physical or virtual server resources to host websites.

Types of Traditional Hosting

Dedicated Server Hosting 💻
- A single physical server is dedicated to one user or organization.
- Offers high performance, full control, and security.
- Suitable for large businesses with high traffic.
- Cost: ₹7,000 – ₹20,000 per month.
- Hosting Provider: Hostinger VPS

VPS (Virtual Private Server) Hosting 🖥️
- A physical server is divided into multiple virtual machines (VMs) using virtualization technology.
- Each VPS has dedicated CPU, RAM, and storage but shares the physical hardware.
- More affordable than dedicated hosting while offering better control than shared hosting.
- Cost: ₹2,000 – ₹10,000 per month.
- Hosting Provider: Hostinger VPS

Shared Hosting 🤝
- A VPS (or physical server) is further shared among multiple users.
- Low cost but has limited resources, security, and performance due to multiple websites sharing the same server.
- Suitable for small websites, blogs, and startups.
- Cost: ₹50 – ₹100 per month.
- Hosting Provider: GoDaddy Shared Hosting

2️⃣ Cloud Hosting (e.g., Amazon EC2) ☁️
- Websites are hosted on multiple interconnected servers rather than a single machine.
- Highly scalable – resources can be increased or decreased as needed.
- Pay-as-you-go pricing (you only pay for what you use).
