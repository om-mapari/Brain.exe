**DevSecOps Engineer** is a great title **if you want to highlight your focus on security within DevOps**. Since you've worked on:

✅ **Security & Compliance** (AWS Config, IAM policies, security tagging, compliance remediation)
✅ **Vulnerability Scanning** (SonarQube, Veracode, Prima Image)
✅ **Monitoring & Alerting** (CloudWatch, AWS Health Dashboard, Netcool Alerting Solution)
✅ **Automation & Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, CloudFormation, AWS Service Catalog)

**DevSecOps Engineer** would be an **excellent choice** if you're targeting roles where **security is a major focus** alongside DevOps. However, if security was just a part of your responsibilities rather than the core, **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** or **Senior DevOps Engineer** might be more suitable.
It depends on the **job you’re applying for**—if the role emphasizes security automation, go for **DevSecOps Engineer**. If it's more about cloud & automation, **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** is better. 🚀
