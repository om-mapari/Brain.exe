AM

Today was a day I won't forget anytime soon. I had the pleasure of meeting my team in person for the first time and enjoying a wonderful lunch together.

As we sat around the table, we talked about our backgrounds, our interests, sharing stories and enjoying each other's company, I couldn't help but feel grateful.

As someone who is new to the company, this meant a lot to me. Meeting your colleagues in person for the first time can be intimidating, but the warmth and friendliness of everyone I met today put me at ease. It made me feel like I'm part of a team that values its members and encourages open communication.

I want to extend a special thank you to Nikhil, our CEO, Monika from HR, and Shri, my manager, for organizing such a fantastic team lunch.

Thank you to everyone for making me feel so welcome. I'm excited to be a part of this team and can't wait to see what we'll achieve together.
